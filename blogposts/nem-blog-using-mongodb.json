The blog entries, tags, categories and comments are now stored in mongodb rather than mysql. This has speed advantages in the case of a high read \/ low write blog as all the data for a page load is stored as a single database \"document\".\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to the relational way of storing the data that needs at least 3 JOINS to retrieve the same information. Page load times dropped from ~2 seconds to 40 milliseconds (mostly due to the lean php).","title":"New blog - using tiny php framework and mongodb","status":"publish","name":"nem-blog-using-mongodb","type":"","tags":["mongodb"],"categories":["General\/Techie"],"comments":[]}
