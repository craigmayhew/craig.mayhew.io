Each time, make a note of what the next move is and if we eventually win or not. Draw a statistical conclusion from this information and play the best move.\r\n\r\nThis works brilliantly for a game such as <a href=\"https:\/\/secure.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/wiki\/Chess\">chess<\/a>, but requires alot more processing power for something such as <a href=\"https:\/\/secure.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/wiki\/Go_%28game%29\">go<\/a>. Current computers (at the end of 2010 at the time of writing) simply cannot get through enough simulations to draw any meaningful conclusions.
