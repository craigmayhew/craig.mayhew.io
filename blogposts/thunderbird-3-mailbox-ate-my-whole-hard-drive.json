{"date":"2010-02-28 08:00:22","content":"Thunderbird 3 is awesome, I've only had one issue with it and that's when it used up all the space on my primary drive. I thought it was odd but moved my thunderbird profile to it's own drive. I realised the sent items just kept getting bigger literally as the minutes past. I opened my sent items to find it had duplicated every email about 25 times (and was still duplicating them) this gave me a sent items box that was fast approachiung 30GBs! I downloaded the thunderbird deduplication addon which is available here <a href=\"https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/thunderbird\/addon\/956\">https:\/\/addons.mozilla.org\/en-US\/thunderbird\/addon\/956<\/a>. It removed the duplicate emails but even after running a compact my sent items didn't change size on disk. In the end I renamed the sent item files \"Sent\" and \"Sent.msf\" to \"sent.damaged\" and \"Sent.msf.damaged\" and Thunderbird downloaded a fresh copy. Then once I was sure the emails hadn't been wiped out, I deleted the broken files completely.\r\n\r\nSo far, I haven't had a repeat of this issue and I do not know what caused it. At a guess my Sent Items were corrupted somehow.","title":"Thunderbird 3 mailbox ate my whole hard drive","status":"publish","name":"thunderbird-3-mailbox-ate-my-whole-hard-drive","type":"","tags":["Thunderbird 3"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes"],"comments":[{"author":"Pete","authorEmail":"pete@siviter.biz","authorURL":"","authorIP":"195.74.132.164","timestamp":"2011-01-25 10:23:06","timestampGMT":"2011-01-25 09:23:06","comment":"Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've had this three times now for different users.  I am a little frustrated at Thunderbird for not fixing long standing bugs, I suspect because they are hard to find and it's not exciting work.\r\n\r\nThere is this one and the failure of message pop-ups to display for every message (for multi-account setups) that have been around for literally years.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPete","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b9) Gecko\/20100101 Firefox\/4.0b9"}]}
