The installer would hang most of the time and when it did finally make it to the disk partitioning stage it couldn't see the hard disk.\r\n\r\nEnter into the motherboard BIOS and change the following options:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Under <strong>Main \/ Storage Configuration<\/strong> change \"Configure SATA as ...\" to <strong>AHCI<\/strong>. This will fix linux not being able to see the SATA drive.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nHope that saves you some time and trouble!","title":"Installing Ubuntu 8.04 64Bit on an Asus P5Q Premium Motherboard with SATA drive","status":"publish","name":"installing-ubuntu-804-64bit-on-an-asus-p5q-premium-motherboard-with-sata-drive","type":"","tags":["Ubuntu","Ubuntu 8.04","Asus P5Q Premium"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes","Linux\/Ubuntu"],"comments":[]}
