This will keep a cache of recently visited websites\/images in the computers RAM instead of on the hard disk.\r\n\r\nGo into about:config and set browser.cache.disk.enable to FALSE, then right-click and select NEW -> INTEGER and type browser.cache.memory.capacity <enter> and set to 100000 (for 100mb).\r\n\r\nNow your memory is being used for the cache instead of your hard disk. If you have loads of memory (more the 2GBs) then you could set the cache figure to say 200mb or higher for even better performance.","title":"Firefox Tweak - Memory Cache","status":"publish","name":"firefox-tweak-memory-cache","type":"","tags":["Firefox","Performance"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes"],"comments":[]}
