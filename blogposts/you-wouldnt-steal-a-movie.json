Do you:\r\n\r\nA) Let people know that piracy means you don't make as much money and therefore can't throw such large budgets at films\r\n\r\nB) Find some way to thank people that buy legal copies of music and films\r\n\r\nC) Force everyone that buys a legal copy of a film to watch a ~40 second advert that can't be skipped. A ~40 second advert that implies the audience might steal things. Oh and the advert plays not just once but every time they watch the film.\r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, they chose the unskippable advert! So if you watch two movies a week then you can kiss goodbye to over an hour of you life each year to watching this advert! For PC users there are two ways around this. If you play the movie in media player then the advert starts playing but you can skip it by clicking on the next chapter. If you play the movie in VLC (I recommend VLC instead of media player) then the advert never even plays and is skipped entirely.","title":"You wouldn't steal a movie?","status":"publish","name":"you-wouldnt-steal-a-movie","type":"","tags":["Movie Piracy","Windows Media Player","VNC"],"categories":["Annoyances"],"comments":[]}
