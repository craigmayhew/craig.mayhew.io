In English that means they may have found molecules that help prevent damage caused in Alzheimer's disease.\r\n\r\nAlthough they will have to jump several more hurdles before this can be used in a real world drug, this is a major step for Folding@home. They are also working on applying these techniques to other projects, \"we have pilot projects for Huntington's Disease underway\".\r\n\r\nThe direct link to post is below so you can read it directly from them:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/folding.typepad.com\/news\/2008\/12\/new-fah-results-on-possible-new-alzheimers-drug-presented.html\r\n\r\nKeep up the folding simulations everyone!!!","title":"Folding@home - Possible new Alzeimers Drug","status":"publish","name":"foldinghome-possible-new-alzeimers-drug","type":"","tags":["folding@home","alzheimers","drug"],"categories":["News"],"comments":[]}
