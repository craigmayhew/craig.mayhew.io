After that we had no additional hardware, no major software advances and one huge recession to deal with. However I think that's about to change. Once the new version the folding@home client comes out of alpha\/beta testing and into the main stream we should see another jump. This is because the latest version of the client utilizes multicore and the gpu by default with no complex setup and no need to download an advanced client. This will mean every new install will be a multicore cpu and a gpu install.\r\n\r\nThere are nearly 300,000 CPUs folding but only 24,000 GPUs. I will assume the folding@home considers a cpu to be 1 core so we will have to average this a bit as some computers will have upto 6 cores. I'll assume an average of 3 CPU cores per computer. So within two years of the new release I expect upwards of 70,000 GPUs to become actively folding. Or to put this another way, an additional 10 Petaflops. During that time I would hope the world has left the recession behind and had a doubling of hardware performance. So with a little luck we could be looking folding@home bringing in around 30 Petaflops in 2013\u00a0 if they released the new software tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe folding@home stats page is <s>available <a href=\"http:\/\/fah-web.stanford.edu\/cgi-bin\/main.py?qtype=osstats\">here<\/a><\/s> UPDATE: There is a new stats page: <a href=\"http:\/\/fah-web.stanford.edu\/cgi-bin\/main.py?qtype=osstats2\">here<\/a>.","title":"Folding@Home Growth Forecast","status":"publish","name":"foldinghome-growth-forecast","type":"","tags":[],"categories":["General"],"comments":[{"author":"Craig Mayhew","authorEmail":"craig@mayhew.io","authorURL":"","authorIP":"93.97.160.59","timestamp":"2011-03-28 23:03:06","timestampGMT":"2011-03-28 22:03:06","comment":"Already at 7 native petaflops.
