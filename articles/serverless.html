    <b>Executive summary</b><br>
    The next big thing that's happening right now.
    The premise builds on paradigms before it, allowing you to manage less infrastructure and concentrate on your product.
</p>

<p>
    Serverless means no operating systems, no patches, no orchestration and less scaling concern.
</p>

<p>
    To adopt serverless, there's a few things you will need to change. No servers means no containers, no os patching/upgrading. No on site staging environments (you have this in cloud already though, right?) and less work for your devops.
    Serverless technology has limitations and some applications cannot yet be migrated. For starters, AWS has a 3GB ceiling on memory usage and a 300 second limit on execution time. This makes it great for web apps, but terrible for long running tasks. Over time, these ceilings will be get higher.

    <b>Latest industry developments</b><br>
    2017-11-30 AWS announces the first serverless database service. This takes advantage of AWS Aurora having separate compute and storage layers (really aurora is two services under the hood). You pay for the storage in GB hours and Compute/ram capacity time in per second increments.</p>
    2017-11-30 AWS announces fargate. Manage containers without the orchestration.

    <b>Technical FAQ</b><br>
    Docker allows us to ship the OS layer and the app layer as a single immutable deployment. How do we know that our app that is working in dev, will also work in live?<br>
    There are a few options here.
    <ol>
        <li>Run dev, staging and live in the cloud provider. Don't run anything locally. This ensures identical behaviour in those environments.</li>
        <li>Run just staging and live in the cloud provider. Accept that your local dev environment might pass tests that don't pass when they hit staging.</li>
    </ol>
    I don't trust serverless<br>
    <ul>
        <li>If you trust the entire service/supply chain of your chosen cloud provider, one more service in the chain is going to make very little difference to the sum.</li>
        <li>If your app doesn't work in a serverless architecture then I already consider it a legacy application.</li>
    </ul>
    We don't have great test coverage, will this be a problem?<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Yes, and not just for serverless. If you have poor test coverage, the cost of change puts you at a competitive disadvantage.</li>
    </ul>
