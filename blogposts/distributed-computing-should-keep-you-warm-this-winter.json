Some people might remedy the problem by turning on the central heating but not I. I've turned on more computers and set them running <a href=\"http:\/\/folding.stanford.edu\/\">folding@home<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldcommunitygrid.org\/\">World Community Grid<\/a>. This warms the house just like the central heating except that instead of just generating heat that then seeps out of my house and is slowly wasted, I'm helping to cure cancer too. It would be good if more heating systems were able to make use of the energy before just turning it into heat.\r\n\r\nNow imagine if everyone did this? Suddenly folding@home might have 1000x the processing power and would do the same amount of protein folding this winter as it would normally do as a whole over the next 8 years (taking into account processor performance increases).\r\n\r\nSo what do you say? Will you join me in this protein folding endeavor?\r\n\r\n","title":"Distributed Computing Should Keep You Warm This Winter","status":"publish","name":"distributed-computing-should-keep-you-warm-this-winter","type":"","tags":["folding@home","protein folding","Distributed computing","World Community Grid"],"categories":["General\/Techie"],"comments":[]}
