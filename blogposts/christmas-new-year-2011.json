{"_id":{"$id":"51feb422560e7051629daaae"},"date":"2012-01-03 21:30:35","content":"This year has been a good haul, some awesome presents from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bethaney.co.uk\/\">B<\/a> and family.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"\/uploads\/2012\/01\/Isis-Puzzle-Unlocked.jpg\"><img src=\"\/uploads\/2012\/01\/Isis-Puzzle-Unlocked.jpg\" alt=\"Isis Puzzle Unlocked\" title=\"Isis Puzzle Unlocked\" width=\"175\" height=\"148\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-1588\" \/><\/a> I'm a fan of difficult puzzles (ideally if there is a prize) to the point of sleep deprivation. Let me show you the Isis puzzle. It's titanium, heavy and fits in your hand (but not if you have small hands, then you need two). It's also nearly impossible to open. I'm not giving away any clues at all, we managed it and I'm looking forward to the next challenge.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"\/uploads\/2012\/01\/lego-nxt-grabber-arm.jpg\"><img src=\"\/uploads\/2012\/01\/lego-nxt-grabber-arm-300x177.jpg\" alt=\"LEGO NXT Grabber Arm\" title=\"LEGO NXT Grabber Arm\" width=\"300\" height=\"177\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1593\" \/><\/a> I'm also a fan of LEGO and this year I was ecstatic to see I had the new <a href=\"http:\/\/mindstorms.lego.com\/en-us\/Default.aspx\">LEGO NXT<\/a> kit. I got bored of the default builds and chucked together this remote control arm in an evening. I'm hoping to improve it and bolt it onto a telepresence robot such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wowwee.com\/en\/products\/tech\/telepresence\/rovio\/rovio\">Rovio<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe additional sensors such as the RFID sensor also look very interesting. I've been interested in cataloging everything in the house with RFID chips and then using multiple sensors to see if we can locate the items in 3d space. That way we would never lose anything :)\r\n\r\nThe other cool (some may say odd) present was my DNA results from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.23andme.com\/\">23andme<\/a>. I'm not going into detail on the results but it was well worth the $206 and I think everyone should get this done ASAP.","title":"Christmas\/New Year 2011","status":"publish","name":"christmas-new-year-2011","type":"","tags":["Robots","xmas","LEGO","Isis puzzle"],"categories":["Friends\/Family"],"comments":[{"author":"B","authorEmail":"me@bethaney.co.uk","authorURL":"","authorIP":"93.97.160.59","timestamp":"2012-01-03 21:34:58","timestampGMT":"2012-01-03 20:34:58","comment":"Awesome presents eh? *dusts shoulders*.
