I took off at a local private airfold at 11:15 this morning (I was just a passenger for take off and landing and wasn't in any control). I was able to have a camera suckered to the side window to video the lesson. Take off is at 7:35 in the first video. The final video shows the landing at 11:00 and the inside cockpit at 13:25. The weather conditions were near perfect in the morning but turned wierd in the afternoon. Checkout the handful of hail!\r\n\r\nFor those interested, the Ikarus is a two seater microlight aircraft with a maximum cruise speed of 194kph (120mph).
