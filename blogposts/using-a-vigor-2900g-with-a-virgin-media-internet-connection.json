This can be done by holding down the button at the back with a pin or pen until the light marked \"ACT\" starts flickering rapidly.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Get the <strong>MAC address<\/strong> of the router that Virgin Media sent you. As you will need the same MAC address before the cable\/modem will talk to your Vigor router.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Login to your Vigor router and click<strong> \"Interent Access setup\"<\/strong> &gt; \"<strong>Static or Dynamic<\/strong>\". Then set \"<strong>Broadband Access<\/strong>\" to Enabled, set \"<strong>Obtain IP address automatically<\/strong>\" and then specify the MAC address from your previous router.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Save the settings.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Turn your router off<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Turn your cable modem off.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>wait 5 minutes.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Turn them both back on again and you should have a working internet connection.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>","title":"Using a Draytek Vigor 2900G Router with a Virgin Media Internet Connection","status":"publish","name":"using-a-vigor-2900g-with-a-virgin-media-internet-connection","type":"","tags":["Vigor 2900G","Virgin Media"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes"],"comments":[]}
