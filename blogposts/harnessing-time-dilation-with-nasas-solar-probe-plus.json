Well, it will actually be orbiting the sun and so won't just go hurtling into it. It will orbit at over 200km\/s at a distance of 7 million km from the sun. It's protection will be in the form of a heat shield that will prevent the 2000 degree heat from damaging the prob.\r\n\r\nTime dilation over a 100 year period at 200km\/s, you gain:\r\n\r\n702 seconds.\r\n\r\nYou may also have noticed this is twice as close as I thought possible in my <a href=\"\/blog\/2009\/07\/harnessing-time-dilation-part-2\/\">previous post on time dilation<\/a>.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/science.nasa.gov\/science-news\/science-at-nasa\/2010\/02sep_spp\/\">http:\/\/science.nasa.gov\/science-news\/science-at-nasa\/2010\/02sep_spp\/<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/solarprobe.jhuapl.edu\/funFacts.php\">http:\/\/solarprobe.jhuapl.edu\/funFacts.php<\/a>","title":"Harnessing Time Dilation with NASA's Solar Probe Plus","status":"publish","name":"harnessing-time-dilation-with-nasas-solar-probe-plus","type":"","tags":["nasa","Time Dilation","Time Travel","Space Probe"],"categories":["Astrothoughts"],"comments":[{"author":"Phillip Moore","authorEmail":"pdm@pobox.com","authorURL":"","authorIP":"72.177.53.95","timestamp":"2010-09-09 17:09:24","timestampGMT":"2010-09-09 16:09:24","comment":"Funny, I was just yesterday pondering the speed of our orbit around the galactic center and its impact on time. Our solar system apparently orbits at speed of  220 km\/s. It'd be a nicely complicated bit of math to figure out our relative actual speed accounting for the parts of the orbit which negate some of the forward speed.","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_4; en-us) AppleWebKit\/533.17.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/5.0.1 Safari\/533.17.8"},{"author":"Craig Mayhew","authorEmail":"craig@mayhew.io","authorURL":"","authorIP":"82.10.181.29","timestamp":"2012-04-28 16:29:41","timestampGMT":"2012-04-28 15:29:41","comment":"Woah - so it looks like my original information was wrong on the orbit distance.
