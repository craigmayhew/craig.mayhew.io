{"date":"2010-06-29 23:12:57","content":"Had a bit of a nightmare with this as you can't even get into safe mode to fix the problem. Running a start up repair from the windows CD does nothing. This leaves us with two options for fixing or working around the issue.\r\n\r\nOption 1:\r\n - Revert to a previous restore point using the windows CD to boot into recovery\/repair mode. Obviously this only works if you have restore points.\r\n\r\nOption 2:\r\n1. Insert your Vista CD\/DVD into your drive and boot from it.\r\n2. Select \"Repair your Computer\" from the list.\r\n3. Select \"Command Prompt\" from the recovery choices.\r\n4. At the command prompt type C:\r\n5. Type cd WindowsWinSxS\r\n6. Type rename pending.xml pending.xml.bak\r\n7. Exit and reboot\r\n\r\nPlease remember that option 2 will cause problems if you need to update in future. If and when I solve that, I'll write a blog and post a link to it.","title":"Vista Infinite Reboot Loop \"Configuring Updates Stage 3 of 3 0%\"","status":"publish","name":"vista-infinite-reboot-loop-configuring-updates-stage-3-of-3-0","type":"","tags":["Windows Vista","Reboot Loop","Windows Update"],"categories":["General"],"comments":[]}
