For me, second life didn't allow me to design without limits. Mostly because it has an economy, an economy is built on rules and therefore limitations. I wanted a virtual environment that can extend and supplement my reality. I needed my own virtual space where rules are none existent unless I impose them. I needed my own simulation. Enter <a href=\"http:\/\/opensimulator.org\/\">openSim<\/a>. <a href=\"http:\/\/opensimulator.org\/\">openSim<\/a> is a complete virtual environment much the same as second life where essentially, I can run my own private second life server. I can use as much space as I like, build as big as I like in any way I want to. I'm not limited to a very small quantity of computer resources, I'm only limited by my hardware and how efficiently I use it. Slowly I have begun merging this with other applications that I use in the real world. I intend to blog about these uses I find for the tiny universe I have created and experiments I will run.\r\n\r\nUpdates soon :)","title":"Tiny little universe","status":"publish","name":"tiny-little-universe","type":"","tags":["Virtual Reality"],"categories":["General"],"comments":[]}
