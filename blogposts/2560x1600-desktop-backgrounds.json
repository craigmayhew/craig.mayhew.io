{"date":"2009-05-08 07:26:29","content":"I decided I needed to change my desktop background this morning as they can get boring quickly when you see the same one for months on end. I actually found it difficult to find many images at 2560x1600 as alot of the sites I would normally use didn't allow searching by resolution or just made it difficult to do. In my quest for high resolution desktop backgrounds I have saved these various places that will take you directly to search results pages chock full of wallpapers at 2560x1600 pixels.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/interfacelift.com\/wallpaper_beta\/downloads\/date\/widescreen\/2560x1600\/\">http:\/\/interfacelift.com\/wallpaper_beta\/downloads\/date\/widescreen\/2560x1600\/<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/search\/?q=2560x1600&m=tags&ct=5&mt=photos\">http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/search\/?q=2560x1600&m=tags&ct=5&mt=photos<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pulsarmedia.ro\/search.html?search_fields=all&search_keywords=2560x1600&search_terms=any\">http:\/\/www.pulsarmedia.ro\/search.html?search_fields=all&search_keywords=2560x1600&search_terms=any<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/myhdwallpaper.com\/v\/2560x1600Wallpapers\/\">http:\/\/myhdwallpaper.com\/v\/2560x1600Wallpapers\/<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/wallpaperstock.net\/wallpapers_2560x1600r.html\">http:\/\/wallpaperstock.net\/wallpapers_2560x1600r.html<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.co.uk\/images?q=2560x1600+wallpapers&hl=en&imgsz=huge\">http:\/\/images.google.co.uk\/images?q=2560x1600+wallpapers&hl=en&imgsz=huge<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wallcoo.net\/2560x1600\/index.htm\">http:\/\/www.wallcoo.net\/2560x1600\/index.htm<\/a>\r\n\r\nI decided to go with this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.picturecorrect.com\/wallpaper\/photos\/cityscapes\/new-york-2560x1600.jpg\">New York cityscape<\/a> in the end :)\r\n\r\nEdit on 10\/05\/2009:\r\nI've found the exact place where the new york photo was taken.
