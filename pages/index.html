Welcome!<br /><br />

Working at CRC, I manage a team and write code for a living. In my spare time I <a href="https://github.com/craigmayhew">contribute to open source</a>.<br />
<br />
Wielding the LAMP stack and AWS to earn a living has enabled me to get involved in many side projects including <a href="http://www.Take-A-Way.co.uk/">Take-A-Way</a>, <a href="http://www.bigprimes.net/">BigPrimes</a>.<br />
<br />
Check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which details work arounds and fixes to problems in <a href="/blog/tag/Ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a> but also contains software/programming guides and occasionally dips into <a href="/blog/tag/Time Travel/">time travel</a>.<br />
<br />
Physical things I've made are a <a href="/blog/reprap-4-year-project/">reprap</a>, a <a href="/blog/usb-secure-eraser/">raspberry pi USB eraser</a> and I'm currently working on a solar farm which I will blog about soon.<br>
<br>
Notable blog posts:<br>
