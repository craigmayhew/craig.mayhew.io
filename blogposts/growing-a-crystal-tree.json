It took about 6 hours to grow to this size. \r\n\r\n<a href='\/uploads\/2008\/12\/imag0139.jpg'><img src=\"\/uploads\/2008\/12\/imag0139-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Tree\" title=\"imag0139\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-44\" \/><\/a><a href='\/uploads\/2008\/12\/imag0124.jpg'><img src=\"\/uploads\/2008\/12\/imag0124-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Tree\" title=\"imag0124\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-43\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nIt works by pouring a salt solution into the bottom tray. This is soaked up by the tree shaped card. As the water from the solution evaporates, the salt crystals form. Then, through capillary action, more crystals form, in a process called <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Efflorescence\">efflorescence<\/a>. The colours are generated by ink\/dye that are in the card.\r\n\r\nThis is the tree once it's been left for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n<a href='\/uploads\/2008\/12\/imag0153.jpg'><img src=\"\/uploads\/2008\/12\/imag0153.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Tree\" title=\"imag0153\" width=\"500\" height=\"666\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45\" \/><\/a>","title":"Growing a Crystal Tree","status":"publish","name":"growing-a-crystal-tree","type":"","tags":["efflorescence","Crystals"],"categories":["Friends\/Family"],"comments":[{"author":"Vas","authorEmail":"VasVadum@Gmail.com","authorURL":"","authorIP":"66.143.206.9","timestamp":"2011-06-20 14:37:50","timestampGMT":"2011-06-20 13:37:50","comment":"Mind telling all the parts required?  including for the random colors you seem to have?","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko\/20100101 Firefox\/4.0.1"},{"author":"Craig Mayhew","authorEmail":"craig@mayhew.io","authorURL":"","authorIP":"93.97.160.59","timestamp":"2012-01-03 21:25:20","timestampGMT":"2012-01-03 20:25:20","comment":"Vas, no idea - it was a kit.\r\n\r\nThis was the latest from xmas 2011.\r\n\r\n\/uploads\/2012\/01\/2011-xmas-crystal-tree.jpg","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0) Gecko\/20100101 Firefox\/8.0"}]}
