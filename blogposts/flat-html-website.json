Although I am a little late to the party with some of my code, I am continuing to open source as much as possible, as quickly as possible. This website is now entirely open source and can be found on github: <a href=\"https://github.com/craigmayhew/craig.mayhew.io\">https://github.com/craigmayhew/craig.mayhew.io</a>.<br /><br />I've moved away from using mongodb and instead store the blogposts and pages in simple json files (one file per page/post). It's currently at about 230MBs including photos and screenshots.","title":"Open Source craig.mayhew.io","status":"publish","name":"opens-source-craig-mayhew-io","type":"","tags":["Open Source"],"categories":["Code"],"comments":[]}
