{"date":"2009-06-13 18:51:20","content":"After upgrading to Ubuntu 9.04 I've found the network manager GUI to be far superior to the previous version I was using in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Unfortunately when I was using Ubuntu 8.04 I made some custom alterations to my network setup in the \"\/etc\/network\/interfaces\" file. The Network Manager in 9.04 wasn't keen on this and so refused to manage it, instead it displayed the message \"Wired Network - device not managed\".\r\n\r\nAs a work around I commented out all of my changes by placing a # at the beginning of each line in my interfaces file:\r\n\r\nOpen the interfaces file in an editor:\r\n<pre style=\"border: 1px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; overflow:auto;\">\r\nsudo vim \/etc\/network\/interfaces\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nThis is an example of how my file looked before I modified it. Yours will be different:\r\n<pre style=\"border: 1px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; overflow:auto;\">\r\nauto lo\r\niface lo inet loopback\r\niface eth2 inet static\r\naddress 192.168.0.44\r\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\r\ngateway 192.168.0.1\r\nauto eth2\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nAnd here's the same file again, but I've added #'s at the beginning of each line so that they are ignored:\r\n<pre style=\"border: 1px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; overflow:auto;\">\r\n#auto lo\r\n#iface lo inet loopback\r\n#iface eth2 inet static\r\n#address 192.168.0.44\r\n#netmask 255.255.255.0\r\n#gateway 192.168.0.1\r\n#auto eth2\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nIn order for the changes to take effect, we need to restart the network manager and the applet by running each of these in the command line:\r\n<pre style=\"border: 1px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; overflow:auto;\">\r\nsudo \/etc\/init.d\/networking restart\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nAnd now restart the network manager applet:\r\n<pre style=\"border: 1px solid #FFFFFF; padding: 5px; overflow:auto;\">\r\npkill nm-applet\r\nnm-applet\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nYou should now be able to manage the network connection from within the network manager applet.","title":"Ubuntu 9.04 \"Wired Network - device not managed\"","status":"publish","name":"ubuntu-904-wired-network-device-not-managed","type":"","tags":["Ubuntu 9.04","nm-applet"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes","Linux\/Ubuntu"],"comments":[{"author":"RockU","authorEmail":"rockuw@gmail.com","authorURL":"http:\/\/none","authorIP":"218.9.122.32","timestamp":"2009-06-29 15:23:13","timestampGMT":"2009-06-29 14:23:13","comment":"Thank you.It's very useful.","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko\/2009033100 Ubuntu\/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox\/3.0.8"},{"author":"snake","authorEmail":"linux4all@neobee.net","authorURL":"","authorIP":"81.18.50.226","timestamp":"2009-07-05 13:19:22","timestampGMT":"2009-07-05 12:19:22","comment":"I have same message \u0093Wired Network - device not managed\u0094, and I can't manage the network connections. \r\n\r\nI'll try something else.","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; sr; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko\/2009060308 Ubuntu\/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox\/3.0.11"},{"author":"Bondo","authorEmail":"ericbond007@gmail.com","authorURL":"","authorIP":"98.228.36.149","timestamp":"2009-07-11 19:22:56","timestampGMT":"2009-07-11 18:22:56","comment":"Yes, this also did not work for me.
