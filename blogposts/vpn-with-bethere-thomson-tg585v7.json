Absolutly no outgoing VPN connections would work through this router. There is normally something called \"VPN Pass Through\" that needs enabling on routers to allow outgoing VPN connections. Unfortunately this router has no way of doing that through the web interface so I was forced to use the following \"solution\".\r\n\r\nThis will require you to have a spare DSL router as we will be turning the Thomson router into just a modem by using \"bridging\".
