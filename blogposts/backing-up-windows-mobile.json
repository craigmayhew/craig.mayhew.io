{"date":"2009-09-14 19:23:12","content":"A Friend of mine called Szymon pointed me in the direction of this very neat little app called PIM Backup. It's currently on version 2.8 and available for free from here: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dotfred.net\">www.dotfred.net<\/a>.\r\n\r\nInstead of being frustrated with the bloated active sync software that Microsoft provides simply copy the PIM backup application onto your device. Then run the application via the phone's file explorer. Select your options and it will then backup your data into a compressed file called a \".pib\" file. Copy a backup of the app and the .pib file onto CD\/DVD and there you go, one very quick backup!","title":"Backing up Windows Mobile","status":"publish","name":"backing-up-windows-mobile","type":"","tags":["Backup","Windows Mobile"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes"],"comments":[]}
