How about doing it every day? This project hoped to simplify the process. All you need to do is plug in a usb drive and the process starts automatically. A small, low power and low cost box that easily, securely and quickly erases USB drives for re-use.<\/p><p>All you need is a RaspberryPi model A, a nice case, an LED, resistor and some wires.<\/p><p>Wire the LED into pin 7, wire the resistor to the other LED pin, wire the resistor to a ground pin.<\/p><p>Run the following commands<\/p><p>sudo apt-get install usbmount<br \/>cd \/home\/pi\/<br \/>wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/craigmayhew\/USBCleanser\/master\/dataObliterator.py<br \/>cd \/etc\/usbmount\/mount.d\/<br \/>wget https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/craigmayhew\/USBCleanser\/master\/01_wipe_data<br \/>chmod 755 \/etc\/usbmount\/mount.d\/01_wipe_data<\/p><p>Restart the RPi and away you go.<\/p><p>Full source code available here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/craigmayhew\/USBCleanser\">https:\/\/github.com\/craigmayhew\/USBCleanser<\/a><\/p>","title":"RaspberryPi Automated USB Eraser","status":"publish","name":"usb-secure-eraser","type":"","tags":[],"categories":["General"],"comments":[]}
