Whenever I tried to print I realized there were no printers and going to \"System -&gt; Administration -&gt; Printing\" caused the error \"There was an error during the CUPS operation: 'httpConnectionEncrypt failed'\" when I tried to connect to the local CUPS service. The \"\/etc\/init.d\/cups\" file had completely disappeared and reinstalling the cups package didn't fix it! In the end I marked the cups package for \"complete removal\" which also removes the configuration files. After this I then reinstalled CUPS, \"\/etc\/init.d\/cups\" reappeared and it worked once again. Unfortunately I had to reinstall my printers on this machine.\r\n\r\nSteps were:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Complete removal of CUPS package including the configuration files<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Reinstall the CUPS package.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Start the CUPS service with \"sudo \/etc\/init.d\/cups restart\" in the terminal.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Reinstall your printers<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Print stuff!<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>","title":"Ubuntu 9.10 - There was an error during the CUPS operation: 'httpConnectionEncrypt failed'.","status":"publish","name":"ubuntu-9-10-there-was-an-error-during-the-cups-operation-httpconnectionencrypt-failed","type":"","tags":["Ubuntu 9.10","Karmic Koala","CUPS"],"categories":["General"],"comments":[{"author":"Ryan","authorEmail":"elenbaum@gmail.com","authorURL":"","authorIP":"89.28.10.57","timestamp":"2010-02-24 10:08:05","timestampGMT":"2010-02-24 09:08:05","comment":"Thanks.

I run into the same problem. After finding your post I went to Synaptic for complete removal of cups package, and discovered, that it wasn't installed! After marking it for installation I saw the reason - Synaptic suggested to remove the xpdf-utils! I'd installed this in an attempt to find some OCR software. So, there was a conflict between cups &amp; xpdf-utils, and I didn't paid much attention during installation of xpdf-utils. So cups was uninstalled though all the configuration files remained. Now, after installation of cups (and removal of xpdf-utils) everything works properly.","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8) Gecko\/20100214 Ubuntu\/9.10 (karmic) Firefox\/3.5.8 GTB7.0"},{"author":"A Happy Chappy","authorEmail":"happy_chappy@nospam.com","authorURL":"","authorIP":"82.71.186.77","timestamp":"2010-05-14 13:07:30","timestampGMT":"2010-05-14 12:07:30","comment":"Thanks also - had exactly the same problem and this fixed it for me! :)","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.9) Gecko\/20100401 Ubuntu\/9.10 (karmic) Firefox\/3.5.9"},{"author":"dpc","authorEmail":"dpcoetsee@gmail.com","authorURL":"","authorIP":"146.232.77.178","timestamp":"2011-06-01 16:44:25","timestampGMT":"2011-06-01 15:44:25","comment":"Thanx hooke, that nailed my problem as well. stupid xpdf...","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko\/20110422 Ubuntu\/10.10 (maverick) Firefox\/3.6.17"}]}
