In short the permissions get set wrongly on the network settings files. Symptons include, not being able to see the network icon on the menu, clicking \"Network Settings\" icon on the settings page and having nothing happen etc..\r\n\r\nBefore you run this fix, please understand that you will lose all your saved network connections and you will need to add in your network keys again.\r\n\r\nTo fix:\r\n\r\nPress Alt+F2 and a run box should appear.\r\nThen write \"terminal\" and click \"Run\".\r\nIn the new terminal windows that has appeared type \"sudo gconftool-2 --recursive-unset \/system\/networking\" to clear all the root network connections.\r\nThen type \"gconftool-2 --recursive-unset \/system\/networking\" to clear all the user network connections.\r\nReboot the netbook and the network icon appears again after about 20 seconds but you need to reconfigure the network connections again by adding passwords etc...\r\n\r\nIf this hasn't fixed your problem then this forum has loads more info on the subject <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aspireoneuser.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=2620&sid=7ee9a1caf5a8ccaf10dd281ac6caf861\">http:\/\/www.aspireoneuser.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=2620&sid=7ee9a1caf5a8ccaf10dd281ac6caf861<\/a>.
