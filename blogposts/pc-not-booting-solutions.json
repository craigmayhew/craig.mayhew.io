I thought I'd share them with you so you don't waste time trying to solve them.\r\n\r\nI put a new 4CoreDual-VSTA motherboard in one computer and it refused to boot after wards, moaning about a 0072 error. Some Googling revealed information about this error and drive related problems. I tried unplugging everything and finally found the culprit to be a USB card reader that was in one of the 2.5\" bays. I'm not sure if the card reader is faulty or if the board just didn't like it.\r\n\r\nAlso had another issue with a new Asus P5KPL-VM motherbaord not booting. It turned out that it didn't like the RAM. I tried both a ProMos PC2-4200 512MB and an unbranded PC2-3200 256MB stick which didn't work. It worked fine when I used some Kingston memory.","title":"PC Not Booting Solutions","status":"publish","name":"pc-not-booting-solutions","type":"","tags":["motherboard","0072 error","Asus P5KPL-VM","4CoreDual-VSTA"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes"],"comments":[]}
