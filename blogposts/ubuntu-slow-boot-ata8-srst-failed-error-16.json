During the boot up processes ubuntu would hang for a while and then spit out the following: \"ata8: SRST failed (error:-16)\". It seems one of my drives wasn't responding properly during boot up.\r\n\r\nTo fix this I tried:\r\n\r\n- Disabling floppy drive in bios (This didn't help, but I'm sure it will speed things up slightly as I don't have a floppy drive)\r\n- Set the \"IDE detect time out (sec)\" to 0. It was originally 35. (This didn't help. Be careful when changing this option if you are using IDE drives)\r\n- Unplugged the SATA cable from my DVD drive and plugged it back in again. (PROBLEM SOLVED!)\r\n\r\nI imagine either my sata cable is slightly loose or dodgy and reseating it has sorted the problem. If the problem occurs again then I will replace the cable.","title":"Ubuntu Slow Boot: \"ata8: SRST failed (error:-16)\"","status":"publish","name":"ubuntu-slow-boot-ata8-srst-failed-error-16","type":"","tags":["Ubuntu","SATA"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes","Linux\/Ubuntu"],"comments":[]}
