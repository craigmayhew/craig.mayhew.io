    Everyone needs a staging area, a testing ground, and for me <a href="//www.bigprimes.net/">bigprimes.net</a> is where I test deployment of new tech. Detailed below is future tests, and results of previous ones. As usual, it's <a href="//github.com/craigmayhew/bigprimes.net/">opensource</a>.

    <br><b>Future: World computer</b><br>
    Golem currently looks like the first opportunity to try distributing a problem over a trustless and distributed cloud.

    <br><b>Future: Decentralized file storage</b><br>
    Sia currently looks like the best opportunity for a decentralised data backup. In future it may become possible to test serving files from the edge.

    <br><b>2017: Serverless</b><br>
    Moving an old php powered website to serverless in a lift and shift fashion was surprisingly simple and resulted in instant cost savings. However, the AWS api gateway service is causing costs to be higher than expected. This could be due to browsers polling the site for icon files that don't exist on every page view. More investigation is needed.

    <br><b>2014: AWS S3 Torrents</b><br>
    This was very simple and worked without any unexpected side effects <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html</a>

    <br><b>2009: Distributed computing</b><br>
    During the trial we didn't see any badly behaved clients, but using an SQL database did show scale limitations. A schemaless approach should be used instead.
