Welcome!<br /><br />

I write code for a living, and in my spare time I maintain this site.<br />
<br />
Wielding PHP, Javascript and MySQL to earn a living has enabled me to get involved in many side projects including <a href="http://www.Take-A-Way.co.uk/">Take-A-Way</a>, <a href="http://www.bigprimes.net/">BigPrimes</a>.<br />
<br />
Check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> which details work arounds and fixes to problems in <a href="/blog/tag/Ubuntu/">Ubuntu</a> but also contains software/programming guides and occasionally dips into <a href="/blog/tag/Time Travel/">time travel</a>.<br />
<br />
Physical things I've brought into existance are a <a href="/blog/reprap-4-year-project/">reprap</a> (which took me 4 years due to time constraints), a <a href="/blog/usb-secure-eraser/">raspberry pi USB eraser</a> and I'm currently working on a solar farm which I will blog about soon.
