Plug a cross over cable between the old and new router (if it's a direct connection). Make sure to plug the cable into the old router's LAN port (there might be several of these, any will do). Don't plug the cable into the WAN port on the old router as this will not work.\r\n\r\nNow you should be all set and able surf the internet!","title":"Using an old\/unused wireless router as just an access point","status":"publish","name":"using-an-oldunused-wireless-router-as-just-an-access-point","type":"","tags":["router","wireless","recycle","wireless access point"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes"],"comments":[]}
