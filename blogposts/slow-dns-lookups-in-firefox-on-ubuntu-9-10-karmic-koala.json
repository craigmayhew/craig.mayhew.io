Then change the value network.dns.disableIPv6 to TRUE.\r\n\r\nThe bug can be tracked here:\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/ubuntu\/+source\/network-manager\/+bug\/417757\">https:\/\/bugs.launchpad.net\/ubuntu\/+source\/network-manager\/+bug\/417757<\/a>","title":"Slow DNS Lookups in Firefox on Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala","status":"publish","name":"slow-dns-lookups-in-firefox-on-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala","type":"","tags":["Firefox","Ubuntu 9.10","Karmic Koala","DNS"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes","Linux\/Ubuntu"],"comments":[{"author":"Shawn","authorEmail":"sfeigel@gmail.com","authorURL":"","authorIP":"71.209.26.253","timestamp":"2009-11-11 21:38:33","timestampGMT":"2009-11-11 20:38:33","comment":"Thank You so much for posting this quick fix.
