It showed what appeared to be dead pixels before doing any number of weird things before crashing altogether. We tried formatting the hard disk, but it crashed while formatting. We tried taking the PS3 apart and cleaning out all the dust from the heat sink. As it turned out there wasn't much dust. We even tried formatting a few more times just to see if it would make it to 100%, it didn't.\r\n\r\nThe fix was to take the hard drive out, carefully brush the dust off of it and reseat it back in the ps3. It's been working fine since.","title":"PS3 Freezing\/Crashing Constantly (Fixed!)","status":"publish","name":"ps3-freezingcrashing-constantly-fixed","type":"","tags":["ps3"],"categories":["Guides\/Fixes"],"comments":[]}
