This is because currently to use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.opennicproject.org\">openNIC<\/a> - you need to change your DNS configuration to use their servers instead of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icann.org\/\">ICANN<\/a>. For most, this is a pretty daunting task. The only way this will become wide spread is if enough people requested that their ISP start resolving these new (and free!) top level domains.\r\n\r\nAgain none of these following links will work unless you are setup to use the alternate DNS.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/grep.geek\/\">grep.geek<\/a> - Currently the only search engine I could find.\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/openniclist.ing\/\">openniclist.ing<\/a> - A website listing, similar to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dmoz.org\/\">dmoz.org<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/monitor.ing\/list\">monitor.ing<\/a> - A website that monitors the openNic servers across the world and allows you to see any problems.\r\n\r\nThis last one you can actually visit - it explains how to setup and use the alternate DNS on your hardware.\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.opennicproject.org\">www.opennicproject.org<\/a>","title":"craig.geek","status":"publish","name":"craig-geek","type":"","tags":["DNS","openNic","ICANN"],"categories":["General\/Techie"],"comments":[{"author":"maximi89","authorEmail":"maximi89@gmail.com","authorURL":"http:\/\/maximi89.blogspot.com","authorIP":"201.223.191.39","timestamp":"2011-02-09 23:33:32","timestampGMT":"2011-02-09 22:33:32","comment":"Excelente project! i'm using it, you could try to public this in the english sites of \"DNS LIST\" which appear on Google... i do it with the spanish websites :D","browser":"Mozilla\/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b11pre) Gecko\/20110202 Firefox\/4.0b11pre"}]}
